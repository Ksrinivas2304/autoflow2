# Autoflow

**Autoflow** is a modern workflow automation platform that empowers users to visually design, automate, and manage business processes by connecting a variety of services and data sources. With an intuitive drag-and-drop interface, users can build complex workflows that integrate with cloud services, databases, messaging platforms, and AI toolsâ€”all without writing code. Autoflow is designed for teams and organizations seeking to streamline operations, automate repetitive tasks, and enable seamless integrations across their tech stack.

## Overview

Autoflow enables you to visually create, edit, and run automated workflows that integrate with various services (email, Slack, APIs, databases, AI, and more). The platform consists of a React/TypeScript frontend and a Node.js/Express/Prisma backend with a PostgreSQL database.

---

## Features

- **Visual Workflow Editor**: Drag-and-drop nodes to build automation flows.
- **OAuth & Organization Requirement**: Most nodes require you to connect via OAuth and be part of a reliable organization account. This ensures secure and authorized access to third-party integrations.
- **Limited Node Availability**: For now, only a subset of nodes are available while the platform is in early development. More integrations and node types will be added soon.
- **Triggers**: Webhook, schedule, S3 file, file upload, and more.
- **Actions**: Send email, Slack message, API requests, push to Airtable, database operations, and more.
- **Data Processing**: Parse CSV, enrich data via API, etc.
- **AI Integrations**: PDF text extraction, text summarization (OpenAI, HuggingFace).
- **Logic Nodes**: If/Else, Loop, etc.
- **Integrations**: Google, Slack, Airtable, Firebase, Redis, PostgreSQL, S3, and more.
- **User Authentication**: Register, login, and profile management.
- **Workflow Run History**: Track and view past workflow executions.

## Architecture

```
[ React Frontend ]  <-->  [ Node.js/Express Backend ]  <-->  [ PostgreSQL (Prisma ORM) ]
```

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Vite, TailwindCSS, React Flow
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, Prisma, BullMQ (queue), Redis (for queue), PostgreSQL
- **Integrations**: OAuth for Google/Slack/Airtable, SMTP, external APIs

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- npm or yarn
- PostgreSQL database
- Redis (for workflow queue)
- BullMQ

### 1. Clone the repository
```sh
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd autoflow2
```

### 2. Backend Setup
```sh
cd autoflow-backend
npm install
npx prisma migrate deploy  # Or: npx prisma migrate dev
npm run dev
```

### 3. Frontend Setup
```sh
cd ../autoflow-frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The frontend will run on [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) by default.

## Database
- Uses PostgreSQL
- Prisma ORM models: User, Workflow, UserIntegration, WorkflowRun
- Migrations are in `autoflow-backend/prisma/migrations/`

---

## Usage
- Register a new account or login
- Create a new workflow from the dashboard
- Drag nodes (triggers, actions, logic, integrations) onto the canvas
- Configure each node (API keys, parameters, etc.)
- Save and run your workflow
- View run history and results

---

## Supported Nodes (Examples)
- **Triggers**: Webhook, Schedule, S3 File, File Upload *(only a subset may be available in the current version)*
- **Actions**: Send Email, Slack Notification, API Request, Airtable, Database (Postgres, Firebase, Redis) *(availability may be limited)*
- **Data Processing**: Parse CSV, Enrich Data *(availability may be limited)*
- **AI**: PDF Extract, AI Summarizer *(availability may be limited)*
- **Logic**: If/Else, Loop *(availability may be limited)*

---

## Development
- Backend: `cd autoflow-backend && npm run dev`
- Frontend: `cd autoflow-frontend && npm run dev`
- Shared node schemas: `shared/nodeSchemas.ts`
